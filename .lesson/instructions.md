# Loop Debugging With Print: Instructions  
 
Practice debugging a loop by adding print statements.

The code is supposed to solve this challenge:

> _Print the sum of the odd numbers between 10 and 25_

But it's not correct.

You don't need to fix the code - just figure out what the bug is using `print`. 

* Add `print` before, during, and after the loop.
* Run the code to see the results
* When you figure out what's wrong with the loop, write the bug in comments at the end of the file.
