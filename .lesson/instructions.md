# Instructions  

Write a program to build an AC unit load estimator. Your program should get input from the user, use the formula to calculate the horse power, then print the horsepower.

Calculate AC load with this equation:

```python
horsepower = width * height *  0.1 + number_of_people * 0.06
```

## Steps

1. Get the input from the user.

You'll need to ask for:
- `width` of the room
- `height` of the room
- `number_of_people` in the room

2. Calculate the horsepower using the formula

3. Print out the horsepower.

Run the tests to check your answer.
