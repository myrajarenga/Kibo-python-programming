# Money for Books: Instructions

Write a program that tells users if they have enough money to buy their desired number of books. 

Each book costs $20. The program should ask the user to enter how many books they want to buy, and how much money they have.

The program will then let the user know if they have enough money to buy the books. Or, if they don't have enough, it will let them know how much more is needed.

If they have enough, print:

```
You have enough money, go for it!
```

If they need $12 more to buy the books, print:

```
You need $12 more to buy that number of books
```

If they need more or less than 12, print however much they need.

## Expected Results

Here's what running the program should look like when complete ([link to video](https://www.loom.com/share/68a8c1882238478ab3bac31551398319))

With enough money:
```
How many books do you want to buy? 4
How much money do you have? 100
You have enough money, go for it!
```

Without enough money:
```
How many books do you want to buy? 2
How much money do you have? 16
You need $24 more to buy that number of books
```

## Steps

- Ask the user to enter desired number of books and money
- Store the values the user enters in appropriately named variables
- Use an if/else statement to show the user a different response, depending on the calculations on what they entered.

## Hints

* Be mindful of the string you print out! The tests are picky. 
* Copy and paste instead of typing it out, so that it's exactly the same.
