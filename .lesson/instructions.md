# Scrabble Word Score: Instructions  

Scrabble is a popular spelling board game. Players get points for spelling words, based on the value of the letters in the word. In this task, you won't build all of scrabble - just a part of the scoring. If you're not familiar with Scrabble, see the "Scrabble scoring" section below for an explanation.

In this assignment, you'll write a program that calculates the score for a word.

__Read all the instructions at least once before you start coding.__

## Your Task

The starter code prints out a greeting, gets a word from the user using `input`, and sets the starting score to zero. You need to add the code to add up the letter values in the word.

Follow the instructions in the comments:
- use a loop to go through the letters in the word
- use `if` and `elif` statements to determine what to add to the score for each letter
- use `in` to check whether the letter is a member of a particular group of letters for scoring.

Below, you'll find an explanation for how to use the `in` keyword in loops and conditions, as well as a table of the scrabble letter values.

## Expected Results

Run the tests to check if your solution is correct.

When it's working, the program should look like this when it's run:

```
Generate the scrabble score for a word.
Enter a word: amorphous
amorphous has a scrabble score of 16
```

```
Generate the scrabble score for a word.
Enter a word: jezebel
jezebel has a scrabble score of 25
```

## Looping over the letters in a string

A `for` loop can loop through the letters in a string. Here's what it looks like to print out each letter in the string `"kibo"`:

```python
for letter in "kibo":
  print(letter)
```

You use the syntax `for x in the_string`. `x` will take on each letter's value in the loop.

## The `in` keyword

The `in` keyword can also test if a letter is inside of a string. If the letter is in the string, `in` returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

```python
'k' in "kibo" # True
'm' in "kibo" # False
letter = "i"
word = "kibo"
letter in word # True
```

You'll need to use the `for ... in` loop as well as the `letter in word` comparison to solve this challenge.

## Scrabble letter values

Each letter tile in scrabble has a point value. Here are the point values and the letters that have that value:

| Value | Letters    |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | aeilnorstu |
| 2     | dg         |
| 3     | bcmp       |
| 4     | fhvwy      |
| 5     | k          |
| 8     | jx         |
| 10    | qz         |


## Scrabble Scoring

A word score in Scrabble is the value of each of the letters, added up. So, the score for "apple" is 9: 

```
a + p + p + l + e
1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9
```

The score for "quixotic" is 

```
q  + u + i + x + o + t + i + c
10 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 26
```

In the actual game of Scrabble, there's also rules about where the word is played on the board, but we're skipping those for this assignment.
